Project Title:
--------------
UDACITY Bikeshare Project

Description:
--------------
This project uses python and add on packages (time, numpy, and pandas) to analyze bikeshare data from the cities of Chicago, New York, and Washington. Please enjoy the haiku I have included in the code. I used a python haiku generator to create the haiku randomly from a list of words.
